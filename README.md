# Background
Driven by a
quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal
jobs. Data hails from my [SQL Coursel (https:// lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential
skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my
SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying remote data analyst jobs? 
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs? 
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts? 
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market,
I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- SQL: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to
query the database and unearth critical insights.
- PostgreSQL: The chosen database management
system, ideal for handling the job posting data. 
- Visual Studio Code: My go-to for database
management and executing SQL queries.
- Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring
collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Remote Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles! I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_title_short,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date::DATE,
    company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10

```

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the
field.
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies Like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest
across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### 2. Skills required for top paying Data Analyst jobs
To identify the top skills required for the highest paying data analyst roles, I used a CTE of the previous query and joined it with my skills tables. This query returns the skills required at these high paying data analyst jobs

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        job_location,
        salary_year_avg,
        company_dim.name AS company_name
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere'
    ORDER BY 
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills AS skill_name
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
```
